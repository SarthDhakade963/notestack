# 🧠 **NoteWise – Smart Notes Dashboard**

> _Your all-in-one, scalable, and secure note management platform — designed to make note-taking simple, organized, and stylish._

---

## 🚀 **Overview**

**NoteWise** is a modern full-stack web application built to demonstrate clean frontend engineering, secure authentication, and backend integration.
It allows users to **sign up, log in, create, edit, and delete notes** — all while tracking real-time dashboard stats like total notes, recent activity, and last updated notes.

This project was built as part of a **Frontend Developer Intern Assignment** focusing on scalability, security, and seamless frontend-backend integration.

---

## ✨ **Features**

### 🖥️ Frontend (Next.js + NextAuth)

- Built using **Next.js 16 (App Router)** and **TypeScript**
- Authentication handled with **NextAuth (Credentials Provider)**
- **JWT-based** secure sessions with access tokens
- **Protected routes** for authenticated users
- **Responsive design** using Tailwind CSS
- Realtime UI updates with **SWR** for cached and reactive data fetching

### ⚙️ Backend (Express + Prisma)

- Backend built with **Node.js & Express**
- **JWT authentication middleware** for secure APIs
- **Prisma ORM** connected to a database (MongoDB / PostgreSQL)
- Password hashing with **bcrypt**
- REST APIs for:

  - Signup / Login
  - CRUD operations on Notes
  - Dashboard stats (total notes, recent updates, etc.)

- Centralized error handling and validation

## 🧩 **Tech Stack**

| Layer          | Technology                                    |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Frontend       | Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, SWR        |
| Authentication | NextAuth (Credentials Provider, JWT)          |
| Backend        | Express.js, Node.js                           |
| Database       | Prisma ORM + PostgreSQL (or MongoDB)          |
| Security       | bcrypt, JWT                                   |
| Deployment     | Vercel (Frontend), Render / Railway (Backend) |

## 🔐 **Authentication Flow**

1. User logs in using email and password (NextAuth Credentials Provider).
2. NextAuth validates credentials by calling the Express backend.
3. Backend returns a **JWT access token** if valid.
4. NextAuth stores session data securely and attaches the token to each API call.
5. All protected routes (like `/dashboard`) are only accessible when authenticated.

---

## 📊 **Dashboard Overview**

The dashboard provides:

- **Total Notes** – Total number of notes created by the user.
- **This Week** – Notes created in the last 7 days.
- **Last Updated** – Timestamp of the last edited note.
- **Live Updates** – Automatically revalidates stats using SWR whenever notes are added or deleted.

## 🧠 **Scalability & Architecture**

The app follows a **modular monorepo-style architecture**, separating frontend and backend while keeping integration tight via environment-based URLs.

### Future Scalability Plan:

- Introduce **microservices** for authentication and notes
- Add **Redis caching** for frequent queries (like dashboard stats)
- Integrate **Cloud Storage (AWS S3)** for file uploads
- Implement **role-based access control (RBAC)** for multi-user features
- Add **unit tests** using Jest + React Testing Library

---

## 🧪 **Setup & Run Locally**

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/notewise.git
cd notewise
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3️⃣ Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file for Next.js:

```env
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_secret
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
```

And a `.env` file for Express backend:

```env
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
PORT=5000
```

### 4️⃣ Run Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

### 5️⃣ Run Frontend

```bash
npm run dev
```

## 🧰 **Postman Collection**

All API routes are documented and tested via a Postman collection included in the repo under `/docs/postman_collection.json`.

To import the Postman collection:

1. Open Postman
2. Click _Import_
3. Select `docs/postman_collection.json`
4. Explore and test the API routes
